They say the going on the earth is just to get it
So I'mma try til I die, til I'm a spirit
Lord said give it all so I'mma give it
Until my plans on this earth ain't sleep a minute
Aye, so I hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hey
Hustle small, ay

Sunlight til moonlight, 365
The daily operation while the plan is revolved
Strive, go against the grind when you grind
'Cause getting money don't make money
I'm designed in the image of the most I... He assigned me
So I walk the earth with the jewels in my mind
Take my kevels in bits and pieces
Double that, stack it up and get the car and the crib
Sitting lovely, so defiant
My whole alliance on the same science
Fuck around and try us
Giants, gold touch, Midas
We don't talk much, we let our history define us

They say the going on the earth is just to get it
So I'mma try til I die, til I'm a spirit
Lord said give it all so I'mma give it
Until my plans on this earth ain't sleep a minute
Aye, so I hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hey
Hustle small, ay

Wake up in the morning, thank John for the blessing
Wide my eyes, still yawning, get ready for today's lesson
Positive thoughts, progression
That's the mind sayin
I got goals and dreams and hey ain't mine yet
I'm banking in the paint in the red zone
3rd in gold, got my head down, coming with my shoulder
Failure is not an option, you got one chance
To make the best out of this and I'mma fuckin dance
You wanna be a star? I'm beyond that
Reaching for the galaxies afar, where the gods at?
Put me in the room where them odds at
Watch me maneuver through terrain like a bobcat, hustling
A wise man once told me it's a difference between a fantasy and a dream
It's real, no one's phony
My fantasy is death, it can never be
A dream can be achieved, look at me

They say the going on the earth is just to get it
So I'mma try til I die, til I'm a spirit
Lord said give it all so I'mma give it
Until my plans on this earth ain't sleep a minute
Aye, so I hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hustle
Hustle small, hustle
Hustle big, hey
Hustle small, ay

Get that fedda a matter fact
I never knew I had a lack
Til I saw that preacher with that Cadillac
I want it when I roll with my nana, ain't that a fact?
Cookies â€“ how they crumble, I guess I gotta just start from scratch
No seminar to teach me how to when repeat me
I guess the streets gotta show me what the school didn't teach me
Hustle, getting more, getting custom
Get your credit score up, now you can't tell em nothing
But everything start as quick as that
I took a dead end job and lost and figured facts
I figure if I saw the bigger picture and pictured that
I get to where I'm going like a manifestation that I piggyback
Off this rap shit, I got up what I'm gone
I'm well and established and here's how I grown
Every day is still a hustle and even through the struggle
We maintain, we gotta get it, now we doin double

They take kindness for weakness
So I don't hang with weaklings
With a pin I birth mean as versus look at daddy's little inklents
You got no idea what I'm capable of
Just know when to be done with love
My awareness has expanded
Once again, one of the most higher seeds has landed
Can I be candid? Life ain't sweet
But on everything I'mma make sure my family eat
They try to silence us, don't worry
I'll speak up bitch, I'll holla
They playin my song, getting dollars
Are you bitches spinnin? Be honest
Are you happy and depressed?
Would you be working hard up a choo choo stress?
You was going hard but now you're doing less
You let the voices of the wild convince you that you weren't blessed
You forgot who you are star
Shine how you were meant to do
Don't worry about the past,
Just know what you finna do
Balls up, get your money up, buy a house for your mom
Hustle then hustle harder til they drop those bombs
