Sometimes when I'm really not so happy
It seems no matter what I do, or no matter how I try
I really can't get high...

I think about the lessons life has given me;
Now I know exactly what to do...
I'm gonna push it back and turn around the feelin'
'Cause that is when the sun comes shinin' through...

Yes, it's true (yes, it's true...) that it's all up to you...

It's feelin' that your feelin' right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...
It's feelin' that your feelin' right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...

All at once I found the perfect feelin';
I can't believe what seemed so hard comes so easily;
It came all over me...
Now I've got to find a way to show you
'Cause it's too good to lock inside myself...
So just push it back and turn around the feelin';
It's best when you can share it with someone else...

Yes, it's true (yes, it's true...) that it's all up to you, hoo-ooh!

It's feelin' that your feelin' right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...
It's feelin' that your feelin' right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...
It's feelin' that your feelin' right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...

It's feelin' that your feelin's right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...
It's feelin' that your feelin's right, it's feelin' that your feelin's right...
Feelin' that your feelin' right, feelin' that your feelin's right...
