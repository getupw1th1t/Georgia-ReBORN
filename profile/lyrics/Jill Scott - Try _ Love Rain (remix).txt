Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degrees, he was brown
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives

Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest
Easy, talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors and memories of the shell tops
Adidas, he was fresh

Like summer peaches sweet on my mind
Like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm
No jacket, no umbrella, just warm

At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt Dizzy and Sonia, heaven and Miles between my thighs

Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts

I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bip
And he was my love
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin' and slowly and sweetly
And stinging my eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine

Wide open, wide loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made, love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new

Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling and I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off it's axis

Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degree, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Wide open wide loose
The mistake was made, love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap

And us became new
Me not clairvoyant and in love
Made me the fool
You were never true

If you didn't want me
Ah you should have let me know
All you did was make a mockery
Of something so incredible, beautiful

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
(I honestly did love)
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
