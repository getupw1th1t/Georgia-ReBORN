[Verse 1: Raveena]
Simple things always mean the most to me
Fruit stains, mango in between your teeth
First ray of the morning
Shining in your hair
Mama greets the morning, yeah
With a simple prayer

[Chorus: Raveena]
Floating on by
My baby and I
Floating on by
The sun in our eyes

[Verse 2: Hope Tala]
Floating real slowly
I feel like you know me so well
And, baby, I know you
Sugar sweet like I always do, do
Love is better, love is better
When we're together, when we're together
Together
[Chorus: Raveena]
Floating on by
My baby and I
Floating on by
The sun in our eyes
Floating on by
My baby and I
Floating on by
The sun in our eyes

[Outro: Raveena]
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
Don't come down
