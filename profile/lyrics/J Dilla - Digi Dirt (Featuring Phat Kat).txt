Now who bringing the dirt?
Who bringing the dirt?
Take it to 'em hard, it's official
Dog, you better than that

Yo, I'm changing my karma then the anger that I'm harnessing
The flame that I'm chartering remains in the bargaining
Restrain 'cause I'm harboring the lane to your martyrdom
Enslaving and hollering they came from the father son
And holy ghost is modern

Explaining why I'm charging 'em, enslaving the homonym
Reclaiming the Cottage Inn, acres of new farmer gin
As niggaz wanna ras stop at Cathouse
So hop on in I aim and disarm 'em

Dangerous and dottering, blame for the sovereign
Detroit hip-hop for James and his mom and them
Got ravens to rotten men's engaged and I'm locked in
You praise and you honor him For King that is optimum

It's my Dukes back at you with another Dilla exclusive
