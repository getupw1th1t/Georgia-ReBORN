This song is dedicatedto the mothers and the children of the revolution
From Tupac, to Afeni Shakurand many many more
This is for you
One love, one lifeCan you see.
The pride of the panther
As she nurtures.
Her young all alone
It's the seed.
That must grow regardlessof the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see.
The pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed.
That must come to harvest
It's the tree.
That must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the pantheras he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placedin the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the pantheras she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow regardlessof the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthersas they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with brilliance andoutshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begunCan you see the pride in the pantheras he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling the obstacles placedin the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the pantheras she nurtures her young all alone?
The seed must grow, regardlessof the fact that it's been planted in stone
