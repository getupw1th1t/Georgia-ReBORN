>> Album rating: 5 <<  Mike Paradinas' first success story from the frontlines of ambient/electro/drum'n'bass experimentation comes via his second attempt, Lunatic Harness. Following the brief but for the most part uninteresting toy-box chop-up of 1996's Urmur Bile Trax, the album escapes the mire of noncommittal cheekiness (an affectation that also damaged some of his Jake Slazenger work) by returning to early releases such as Tango N' Vectif and Bluff Limbo for inspiration, fusing pretty, affecting melodies and dynamic ambient atmospheres with beats that manage a tight balance between structured groove and complete chaos.
