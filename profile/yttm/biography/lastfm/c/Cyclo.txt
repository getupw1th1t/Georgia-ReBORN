Ryoji Ikeda, from Japan, and Carsten Nicolai, who hails from Germany, are leading representatives of contemporary electronic music and the art of sound. 10 years ago, they founded the project Cyclo., which comes under the heading of sound visualization. In their collaborative works, the two artist-composers create new hybrid forms of audiovisual art that are situated somewhere between concert, installation and film and push the boundaries of digital technology.

Carsten Nicolai works at the interface between art and science – his world is like a laboratory. Ryoji Ikeda focuses on sound as something felt by the senses. Cyclo.'s synthetic live shows are fascinating thanks to their puristic, elegant simplicity and cool technicalism.
