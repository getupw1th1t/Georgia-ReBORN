### My prioritized todo list

* Always update Georgia-ReBORN to Georgia's latest version:
Currently updated to Georgia v2.0.3.

* Fix Georgia-ReBORN Wine Bugs under Linux:
https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN/issues/2

* Figure out if it's possible to repaint playlist title_color without using initialize_rows() & create_headers when using Reborn/Random theme or theme style Black And White Reborn
  to fix the ugly title_color repaint when text changes to black or white color. Best visible if using Options > Playlist > Always scroll to current playing song
  and using the transport next button with random shuffle mode on or while playlist scrolling. Cosmetic fix only used if active playlist has less than 5000 playlist items for performance reason.
